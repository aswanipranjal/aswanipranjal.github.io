      <description>Before the orgs were announced Since I enrolled into Engineering back in 2014, I wanted to participate in GSoC. I tried to apply in 2016 and 2017 but didn&amp;rsquo;t get in. This is my final year of Engineering and this year I meant business.
I was interning at Network Intelligence India (1) Pvt. Ltd. when the program schedule for 2018 was announced. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a concrete plan in mind at that time but I knew that I wanted to apply.</description>
