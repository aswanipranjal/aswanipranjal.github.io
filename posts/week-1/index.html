    <p>This week was interesting! I read the manuscripts base code and played with a lot of functions to learn how they work. It was fun because after being stuck on a few functions and classes, I finally understood that I should burn my laptop, giveup and go home. Good bye!</p>

<p>Just kidding! I was actually able to add some functionality that I think will be cool. Currently Manuscripts code only performs aggregations(sum, average, count and such) for the required Metrics. I thought why not get specific data for the metrics from the indices and create bargraphs and maybe pycharts(see what I did there?) to show how the data is changing. I feel that by using only aggregation we will miss out on the extreme values that are present in the data: for example, the metric - <a href="https://github.com/chaoss/metrics/blob/master/activity-metrics/open-issue-age.md">Open issues age</a> has extreme values. Some of the issues might have been open since more than 200 or 250 days and that information will get blurred when we only look at the average of Open issue age.</p>

<p>Currently, the Growth-Maturity-Decline Work Group is working on expanding the Metric&rsquo;s definitions as alot of them still require solid definitions.
Therefore these functions will not be a part of the master branch of manuscripts yet. I have created a branch for the GMD-metrics and the <a href="https://github.com/aswanipranjal/gsoc-manuscripts/blob/master/GMD-manuscripts.ipynb">Notebook</a> will reflect the functions in them.</p>

<p>Apart from that, I made a <a href="https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-manuscripts/pull/55">PR</a> fixing the help menu for Manuscripts.
I also created these 2 issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/issues/1">GMD-WD</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-manuscripts/issues/56">Mis-Matched classes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That was all that I could do this week. I had an exam today so I am free till sunday to work on the Notebook and make PRs for other issues in Manuscripts.</p>

<p>See you next wednesday!</p>

<p>Adios.</p>
