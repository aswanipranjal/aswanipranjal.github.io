      <description>Welcome to Week 4 of Google Summer of Code. It said in one of the emails from Google, that time will move pretty fast. Yep, 4 weeks over!
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the tasks to be completed in this week.
Brief introduction TASK-1: I created the last PR which completes the migration of manuscripts to elasticsearch_dsl module. The main purpose of this PR was to change esquery.py and metrics.py so that the functions do not directly query elasticsearch.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to the third week of Google Summer of Code. I hit a couple of speed bumps this week.
Highlights: Task-1: Complete cleaning esquery.py file, add tests and make the whole manuscripts project use elasticsearch_dsl.py module.
Progress: I was able to complete writing tests for esquery.py and make the comments more detailed. The changes can be found here. This is the part of the previous PR that I made in the previous week.</description>

      <description>Okay, so in week 2, I&amp;rsquo;ve had some good challenges to overcome. I was given 3 tasks this week:
 To cleanup esquery.py file. This file is the primary file to create elasticsearch DSL queries which are sent to elasticsearch to get the required results. To create from scratch, a new notebook which queries elasticsearch enriched indices and calculates the metrics. To think about structure of new classes and functions that can be created for the metrics as the old classes are cumbersome to use.</description>

      <description>This week was interesting! I read the manuscripts base code and played with a lot of functions to learn how they work. It was fun because after being stuck on a few functions and classes, I finally understood that I should burn my laptop, giveup and go home. Good bye!</description>

      <description>This is the first post describing what I have being doing since the starting of the community boding period. There will be one post every wednesday, starting next week, describing what I did the previous week and having links to all the necessary resources to track the project.
Community Bonding (April 23rd - May 10th) The community bonding period lasts from 23rd April - 13th April. During this time, I had to understand how the community works and how I should participate in the discussions that happen.</description>
